                        <p class="semilarge body-copy">We are a company in Okaloosa County which specializes in creating and refurbishing furniture and home decor. We sell our products at a booth inside Defrance Antiques on Beal, Fort Walton Beach.</p>
                        <p class="semilarge body-copy">As of now, we're a team of two: a painter and a woodworker. We have a decade of experience in our respective fields and we started this to allow us to express our creativity and love for what we do in a new way.</p>

                                <p>Madelyn is the painter. Her favorite thing is taking a sad, broken piece of furniture that would be heading to the landfill and turning it into a beauty. She has been slapping paint on pieces and redoing furniture since all the way back to her high school days.</p>

                                <p>James is the creative woodworker. His first major furniture build was a farmhouse table many many years ago. Since then he has gone from following plans for a build, to coming up with his own. This has especially come in handy when Madelyn comes to him with an idea for a project.</p>

                        <p class="semilarge body-copy">
                            Taking a sad piece of furniture and making it into something new has always been something we have loved doing. Previously, James would come up with a furniture idea and create it, then Madelyn would do the final touches, and then we would sell our items to people who contact us on local community groups. This worked well, but we were looking for something a little more.
                        </p>
                        <p class="semilarge body-copy">
                            When we saw Defrance Antiques on Beal was opening, we swiftly got in touch with the owners and we were able to get a booth just a few weeks before they opened. We had just around 15 products. Now, we have near 50 at once and have sold hundreds over the months.
                        </p>

                        <p class="semilarge body-copy">
                             We are so grateful to be blessed with this opportunity, so many people have made this possible, some even giving us old furniture for free for us to breathe new life into it. Without such a great community, this would not be possible. We thank everyone from the bottom of our heart who has purchased anything from our booth.
