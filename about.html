					<h3>Meet the faces behind howesDecor</h3>

                    <p>We are James and Madelyn.</p>

                    <p>James is the creative woodworker. His first major furniture build was a farmhouse table many many years ago. Since then he has gone from following plans for a build, to coming up with his own. This has especially come in handy when Madelyn comes to him with an idea for a project.</p>

                    <p>Madelyn is the painter. Her favorite thing is taking a sad, broken piece of furniture that would be heading to the landfill and turning it into a beauty. She has been slapping paint on pieces and redoing furniture since all the way back to her high school days.
                    </p>

                    <p>We moved to the beautiful Emerald Coast in 2018 and enjoy spending our down time on the beach or water. We have 2 teenage boys, and 1 dog. Both of the boys have been involved in howesDecor, but mostly on the digital side of things: from photography to web development to running our socials.</p>

                    <h3>Our story</h3>

                    <p>We have always loved refurbishing sad pieces of furniture into something that has purpose. James used to create tables and other pieces of furniture for the house, and sometimes we sold them locally through various apps and websites. Madelyn has been painting since her highschool days, and she is what really brought the finishing touches to the pieces we used to sell. </p>

                    <p>So with all this, when we saw the opportunity to have a permanent location to sell and truly commit to our passion, we jumped on it. We found Defrance when we were searching for a place to sell, and we saw that they were opening a location on Beal Parkway. We got in touch with them and we were able to get a booth a few weeks before they opened. </p>
                    
                     <p>We have steadily grown our assortment of furniture and items we sell to what we have now, over 30 unique items we found at yard sales, auctions, some were even given to us to make new again. We are so grateful for this opportunity and we love being able to express our passion in every piece we create. </p>

                     <p>If you want to check out our booth, you can find us at 74b Beal Pkwy NW, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548 - we are booth #228.</p>
