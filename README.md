this is currently being used to host howesdecor's website by being linked to netlify

## To Do
1. finish up all pages - ideally that would be the 2.0 update
2. polish up the site and make it more visually appealing, using more consistent design choices
3. fix up the home page and make it more of a homepage, currently just sends you off to all these different pages. i'd like it to have some featured products, important monthly information (calendar), etc
4. perhaps implement howesdecorlinks.netlify.app into the homepage as well, just like a quick info thing to show what we're about...etc

## Currently working on (1.4.1)
1. continuing to rework blog page logic
2. polishing blog page code to make it work as efficient as possible while keeping it easy to understand
3. implementing fallbacks (no JS, features not available due to browser support)

## Up next (1.5.0)
1. Reworking homepage
2. Reworking nav menu
