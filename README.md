this is currently being used to host howesdecor's website by being linked to netlify
here is the Trello board for this: [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/YrxJq3GR/howesdecor)

## To Do
1. finish up all pages - ideally that would be the 1.10.0 update
2. polish up the site and make it more visually appealing, using more consistent design choices
3. fix up the home page and make it more of a homepage, currently just sends you off to all these different pages. i'd like it to have some featured products, important monthly information (calendar), etc
3.1 - perhaps monthly calendar could include sale dates, it would either just show monthly information automatically or when a day is selected through an input, first would be easier but more cluttered, second would be more complicated but a better UX.
3.2 - progress on making the home page more of a homepage has already started, now includes a featured item section which shows some of the newest items in the booth. althought it does need work and will be fixed in 1.5.0
5. perhaps implement howesdecorlinks.netlify.app into the homepage as well, just like a quick info thing to show what we're about...etc
